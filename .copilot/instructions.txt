SDS200v2 - .NET 10 CLI for Uniden SDS200 Scanner Control

ARCHITECTURE LAYERS (never mix):
- Presentation/ = Spectre.Console rendering only
- Logic/ = Business rules, parsing, state management  
- Bridges/ = Protocol implementations (Serial, UDP)
- Core/ = Interfaces (IScannerBridge, IDataReceiver)
- Models/ = Data structures (ScannerStatus, ContactLogEntry)

KEY RULES:
1. All public members need XML docs (/// <summary>)
2. Private fields use _camelCase, properties use PascalCase
3. No magic strings - use MarkupConstants.cs
4. Escape user input before Spectre markup: Markup.Escape(input)
5. Thread-safe cross-thread data: ConcurrentQueue<T>
6. Commands to scanner end with \r and normalize to uppercase
7. Transient errors return "TIMEOUT"/"DISCONNECTED", don't throw
8. No dependency injection containers - explicit dependencies only

PROTOCOL:
- Serial: Stream buffering with \r delimiter
- UDP Port 50536: Single-packet + multi-packet XML (GLT only)
- Multi-packet uses <Footer No="X" EOT="1"/> for assembly

CONCURRENCY:
- Main thread: UI rendering (AnsiConsole.Live)
- Keyboard task: Non-blocking polling (Console.KeyAvailable)
- Data receiver: Serial events or UDP receive loop
- Use CancellationToken for shutdown, lock (_lock) for state

COLORS (Spectre.Console):
- green = frequency, success
- blue = system/department labels
- yellow = TGID/channel, warnings
- red = errors, hold, disconnected
- grey/dim = metadata

DON'T SUGGEST:
- DI containers, ORMs, global static state
- async void (except event handlers)
- Mixing layers (UI code in Logic/)
- ConfigureAwait(false) in app code

See docs/DESIGN_GUIDE.md for full details.
